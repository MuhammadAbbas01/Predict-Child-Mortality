# Predicting Child Mortality Using Unsupervised Learning on Socio-Economic Data
# Overview

This project aims to analyze socio-economic factors influencing child mortality rates using various unsupervised learning techniques. By leveraging clustering methods, the project identifies patterns and groupings within the data that can assist policymakers in targeting interventions effectively.

Project Structure
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Steps to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and prepare data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizations and summaries to understand the data better.
Modeling: Implementation of various clustering algorithms including KMeans, Agglomerative Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Models, and DBSCAN.
Conclusion: Insights drawn from the analysis and their implications.
Key Insights
The analysis reveals significant correlations between socio-economic factors and child mortality, providing a foundation for targeted health initiatives.

Next Steps
Future work includes refining clustering models, integrating additional data, and exploring predictive modeling techniques.
