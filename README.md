# Predicting Child Mortality Using Unsupervised Learning on Socio-Economic Data

## Overview

This project analyzes socio-economic factors impacting child mortality rates through unsupervised learning techniques. By applying clustering methods, it identifies patterns and groupings within the data, helping policymakers target effective interventions.

## Project Structure

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and preparing data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizations and summaries for deeper data understanding.
- **Modeling**: Implementation of clustering algorithms, including KMeans, Agglomerative Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Models, and DBSCAN.
- **Conclusion**: Key insights and implications drawn from the analysis.

## Key Insights

The analysis indicates strong correlations between socio-economic factors and child mortality rates, offering a foundation for focused health initiatives.

## Next Steps

Future work includes refining clustering models, incorporating additional data, and exploring predictive modeling techniques.

## Requirements

- **Python**
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
